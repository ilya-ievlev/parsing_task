I see a lot of ways to improve this project and polish the code.

in the commented out parts of the code you can find the functionality to go through all pages of the site, but due to the limitations of Google Sheets regarding the number of entries per unit of time, I agree with you that it will be easier to simply process the first page.

Thank you for the opportunity to do your test task. It was interesting to work with Google Sheets API by the way
